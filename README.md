# Testing-Android-Git-Functionality
This is a simple calculator app made with the purpose of experimenting with the Kotlin programming language and with the Android Studio Git integration functionalities.

# Interface
The design of the app is simple, and yes, I did forget adding 0. Oh well.

Regarding the functionality, the application uses a stack to store the input and basically emulates on a lower level the functionality of Microsoft's calculator, at least from a design point of view.
